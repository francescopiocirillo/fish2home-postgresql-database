🐟 fish2home-postgresql-database
================================

**Relational Database in PostgreSQL for Seafood Delivery Management**  
A complete academic-to-production-grade project covering conceptual design, normalization, constraints, triggers, advanced queries, and data population for a real-world delivery scenario.

> Demonstrated expertise in PostgreSQL database design and implementation, including requirements analysis, E-R modeling, BCNF normalization, constraint and trigger-based business rule enforcement, advanced SQL queries, and performance-oriented schema optimization.

* * *

📌 Overview
-----------

**Fish2Home** is a seafood delivery service that connects **fishermen**, **riders**, and **customers** through a fully managed ordering and delivery process.  
This repository contains the **PostgreSQL implementation** of the Fish2Home database, developed as part of the _Database Systems_ course at University of Salerno (2023/2024).

The system manages:

* **Order processing & tracking**
    
* **Fishing methods & vessels**
    
* **Rider zoning & logistics**
    
* **Customer data & payment management**
    
* **Inventory bundles & pricing**
    

This project showcases **end-to-end database engineering skills**:  
from **requirements analysis** → **conceptual/logical design** → **normalization** → **optimized SQL schema** → **advanced query development** → **business-rule triggers**.

* * *

🌍 Language Note
----------------

All **code comments and internal documentation** are written in **Italian**, as the project was developed during a group exam at the **University of Salerno (Italy)**.

Despite this, the **codebase follows international best practices** which makes it easily understandable for global developers and recruiters.

* * *

🚀 Features
-----------

* **📄 Full SQL Schema** — Complete `CREATE TABLE` statements with PK, FK, CHECK, UNIQUE, and DOMAIN constraints.
    
* **🛡 Data Integrity Rules** — Implemented through declarative constraints and procedural triggers.
    
* **⚙ Automated Logic** — Business rule enforcement using PL/pgSQL triggers:
    
    * Ensure fishermen have at least one fishing method.
        
    * Auto-update bundle quantities in orders.
        
    * Enforce rider zone coverage.
        
    * Validate customer payment ownership.
        
* **📊 Analytical Queries** — Complex SELECT statements for:
    
    * Rider workload analysis.
        
    * Customer ordering patterns.
        
    * Quality tracking based on fish temperature at pickup.
        
    * Revenue and consumption rankings.
        
* **👁 Views** — Predefined for cost and weight aggregation per order and city.
    
* **🧪 Sample Data Population** — Ready-to-use dataset for immediate testing.
    
* **📈 Normalization up to BCNF** — Ensures minimal redundancy while optimizing read/write performance.

📊 Example Analytics
--------------------

### 1. Top Customers by Spend

```sql
SELECT cliente, SUM(costo_ordine) AS totale_spesa
FROM CostoOrdinazioni
JOIN Ordinazione ON costoOrdinazioni.ordinazione = codiceordine
GROUP BY cliente
ORDER BY totale_spesa DESC;
```

### 2. Riders Under Pressure

Find riders who are the only worker in their zone and deliver above the average.

```sql
SELECT nome, zona, citta
FROM Rider r1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Rider r2
    WHERE r1.CodiceRider <> r2.CodiceRider
      AND r1.Zona = r2.Zona
      AND r1.Citta = r2.Citta
)
AND (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Ordinazione WHERE Rider = r1.CodiceRider
) > (
    SELECT AVG(ordinazioni_consegnate)
    FROM (
        SELECT rider, COUNT(*) AS ordinazioni_consegnate
        FROM Ordinazione
        WHERE Rider IS NOT NULL
        GROUP BY Rider
    ) sub
);
```
